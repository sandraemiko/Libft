- Description

        This individual project aims to create a C library, gathering commonly used functions
        that we will be allowed to use in all our subsequent projects. In the learning journey 
        at school 42, we are restricted in using standard C library functions and are only
        permitted to use the functions we code ourselves. Therefore, the long-term goal of 
        this library is to grow with our own functions, catering to our development needs.
        For this library, only three standard library functions are allowed: write() from 
        <unistd.h>, which is responsible for writing to a file or output stream, malloc(), 
        and free() from <stdlib.h>, which are used for memory allocation and deallocation, 
        respectively.
        Additionally, we are allowed to use the <string.h> library to access size_t and NULL.
